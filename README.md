# icecast2-web


A modern, web based icecast2 stream player.




## Features

- Responsive
- Lightweight
- No frameworks used, written in pure HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
- Metadata support
- Visualizer
- System media control support

### Planned Features

- Cover art fetching with the musicbrainz API
