# icecast2-web


A modern, web based icecast2 stream player.




## Features

- Responsive
- Lightweight
- No frameworks used, written in pure HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
- Metadata support
- Visualizer
- System media control support

### Planned Features

- Cover art fetching with the musicbrainz API
- Light theme support

## Usage

- Just clone and copy onto your web server
- Make sure you set your `burst-size` to `131070` or higher in your `/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml`, not doing this will cause chromium to load for around 10 seconds before actually starting playback (thank chromium)
